      <p>
        I am a programmer on a continuous journey of learning and creating. During 2023 I successfully completed a 28 week bootcamp where I developed many skills, including React, Node.js, MySQL, JavaScript, and Test-Driven Development. This experience has greatly improved my web development and programming in general. I am currently seeking employement and pursuing various personal projects partially for fun as well as to further develop my skills.
